Best candidate (shift 19, confidence 6.4%):
THERE IS A LOVELY LAND,
IT STANDS WITH BROAD BEECH TREES
NEAR THE SALTY BALTIC SEA;
IT WINDS THROUGH HILLS AND VALLEYS,
AND HUNDINGSTUEN, THE GREAT HALL.
WE FEEL FREE AND JOYFUL.
THE GREEN LEAVES OF THE BEECH TREE
WE SEE AND REJOICE.

IT SHINES SWEETLY IN BLOOM,
AND THE FLOWERS ARE RED,
AND THE SCENT OF THE FLOWERS
WILL BE PRAISED FROM OUR LAND.
