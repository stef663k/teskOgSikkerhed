Drifting alone in the midnight glow
City lights flicker but I still dont know
Where do I run when the echoes call
Chasing my past like a ghost in the hall

Oh shadows and fire they dance in my mind
Burning so bright but Im lost in the night
If I take one more step will I fall or will I fly
Only the stars know the truth in the sky

Footsteps fade where the memories lie
Carved into stories I cant say goodbye
Every scar whispers secrets untold
But I keep walking my heart wont turn cold
